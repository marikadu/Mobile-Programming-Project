This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Pepperoni Pals Pizza Ordering App

-	The main goal of the app is to help the restaurant “Pepperoni Pals” with their business by developing the mobile application for the restaurant. We believe that by creating the following application, the restaurant will have more customers due to the creative approach of the app, at the same time providing the customers the opportunity to order a custom pizza just by using the app on their smartphone.
-	Another goal of the Pepperoni Pals app is to help customers/ users order their pizzas easily (Just by clicking their available toppings). 

## Features:
-	Customising the pizza: the app has multiple screens with pizza creation steps, starting by choosing the dough, then the sauce, and then additional pizza toppings. When the topping is added, the picture appears to demonstrate the pizza
-	See the Menu of what the restaurant offers
-	A timer for the delivery of the pizza
-	Past orders are stored for easy access so the users can always remember that amazing pizza combo they made previously
-	Developer buttons for debugging purposes for the non-existant developer account




# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
